###this function:
#######receives a 2D list/array containing the DH parameters of a robotic manipulator and returns a homogenous transformation for the kinematic chain
def kinematic_chain:
	###set up a loop that scans the rows and multiplies the transformation to get a total transformation.
	
###this function:
#######receives a homogeneous transformation as input and returns the x, y, z components of the position.
def get_pos:
	###contents in assignment sheet
	

###this function:
#######receives a homogeneous transformation as input and returns roll-pith-yaw angles 
def get_rot:
	###order for rotational motion in assignment sheet
